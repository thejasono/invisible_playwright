"""Public helpers for building Firefox launch config without using ``InvisiblePlaywright``.

Use these when you need to call ``playwright.firefox.launch()`` (or
``firefox.launch_persistent_context()``) directly with our patched binary
and stealth prefs, instead of using the ``InvisiblePlaywright`` context
manager.

Typical caller is an external integration that owns its own browser
lifecycle (a Crawlee/Skyvern/changedetection-style fetcher, a Playwright
Server wrapper, a multi-language harness) and just wants the building
blocks::

    from playwright.async_api import async_playwright
    from invisible_playwright import ensure_binary, get_default_stealth_prefs

    async with async_playwright() as p:
        browser = await p.firefox.launch(
            executable_path=str(ensure_binary()),
            firefox_user_prefs=get_default_stealth_prefs(seed=42),
        )

For everyday Python usage the ``InvisiblePlaywright`` context manager is
still the recommended entry point; these helpers expose the same internals
without the lifecycle ownership.

.. note::
   When calling ``firefox.launch()`` yourself, pass ``headless=False`` and
   manage the display hiding (Xvfb on Linux, hidden desktop on Windows)
   externally. Passing ``headless=True`` directly to Playwright puts
   Firefox in true headless mode, which skips the real rendering pipeline
   and breaks canvas / audio / WebGL fingerprint coherence. The
   ``InvisiblePlaywright`` context manager does this translation
   automatically; the public helpers leave it to the caller.

    Same prefs that ``InvisiblePlaywright(seed=..., locale=..., timezone=...,
    extra_prefs=..., humanize=...)`` would inject. Use this when you need to
    drive ``playwright.firefox.launch()`` yourself.

    Args:
        seed: Integer seed for the Bayesian fingerprint sampler. Same seed
            produces the same fingerprint. ``None`` generates a fresh
            random int31 (matches ``InvisiblePlaywright`` default).
        pin: Optional dict forcing specific fingerprint fields while the
            rest stays seed-derived. See ``docs/pinning.md``.
        locale: BCP-47 tag (e.g. ``"en-US"``). Drives ``Accept-Language``
            and ``navigator.language``.
        timezone: IANA timezone (e.g. ``"America/New_York"``). Empty means
            use the host TZ. This pure pref builder does NOT resolve
            ``"auto"`` (that needs the proxy + a network lookup at launch
            time) — pass a concrete zone here, or use ``InvisiblePlaywright``
            / ``resolve_session_timezone(timezone, proxy)`` for ``"auto"``.
        extra_prefs: Optional dict overlaid LAST onto the generated prefs.
        humanize: When True (default), every mouse move is expanded into
            a Bezier trajectory by the patched Juggler. A float caps the
            motion in seconds. False disables the behavior.
        virtual_display: When True on Windows, apply GPU-disabling prefs
            to prevent GPU process crashes on virtual desktops without
            D3D11 backend.

    Returns:
        Dict ready to pass as ``firefox_user_prefs=`` to
        ``playwright.firefox.launch()`` or ``launch_persistent_context()``.
