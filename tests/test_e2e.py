"""E2E tests for the launcher lifecycle.

Tests requiring the patched Firefox binary are gated behind the
``firefox_binary`` fixture, which skips the test cleanly when the
binary is not cached locally and cannot be downloaded (e.g. no
network or no release token). The constructor-only tests (seed
handling) do not need a binary and always run.
