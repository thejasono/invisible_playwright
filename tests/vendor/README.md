# Vendored detection libraries (test-only)

These are upstream, unmodified, MIT-licensed browser-fingerprinting / bot-detection
libraries, vendored so the detector e2e tests run **hermetically and identically**
on a dev box and on a GitHub runner (no external CDN at test time — Firefox
tracking-protection blocks the openfpcdn.io CDN anyway, and we want CI offline).

They are served from a localhost HTTP server and loaded into the patched Firefox;
the tests assert the REAL detectors don't flag the stealth build (BotD: `bot===false`;
fpscanner: engine-agnostic rules clean; CreepJS: `headlessRating===0` + no JS-proxy
tells) and that the fingerprint is stable (FingerprintJS: same `visitorId` across
launches). CreepJS runs fully offline — the tests abort every non-loopback request,
so its optional crowd-comparison POST never fires and the verdict is computed locally.
