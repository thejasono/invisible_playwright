"""Regression: the produced wheel must not contain duplicate zip entries.

The old pyproject.toml had a ``[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel.force-include]``
section that re-included `data/` and `_fpforge/data/` already covered by
``packages = ["src/invisible_playwright"]``. Hatchling wrote every JSON twice
into the zip; PyPI rejects wheels with duplicate names.
