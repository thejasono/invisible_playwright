"""End-to-end release tests.

These exercise the FULL user install path against the LIVE GitHub release.
They are slow (download a ~110 MB binary, launch Firefox) and require network
access — marked `e2e` so they're excluded from the default suite. Run them
BEFORE announcing a release:

    pytest tests/test_release_e2e.py -m e2e -v

Or to target a specific git revision (default is current HEAD on origin/main):

    INVPW_E2E_REV=v0.1.5 pytest tests/test_release_e2e.py -m e2e -v

What each test verifies and why it exists:

  test_clean_install_from_git_main:
    Spawns a fresh venv and pip-installs the wrapper from git HEAD. Confirms
    the package has no broken metadata, missing deps, or import errors in a
    pristine environment. Catches the "works on my machine because I already
    have the dev deps" class of bug.

  test_fetch_against_live_release:
    After the install, runs `python -m invisible_playwright fetch --force`,
    which downloads the live tarball + checksums.txt for the pinned
    BINARY_VERSION from the production GitHub release. This is THE test that
    would have caught LostBoxArt's #15 — the checksums.txt parser bug only
    manifested against the real binary-mode format the release ships, not
    against unit-test mocks.

  test_version_command_after_fetch:
    Confirms `python -m invisible_playwright --version` resolves the binary
    and reports the expected `firefox-N` tag. Sanity check that the binary
    landed in the cache and the wrapper can find it.

  test_playwright_launch_against_real_site (linux-only by default):
    Launches the patched Firefox under the wrapper, navigates to a stable
    public URL, and reads a known DOM property. This is the full stack:
    wrapper init → Firefox launch → Juggler handshake → page.goto →
    page.evaluate. If anything along the way regresses (Juggler protocol
    schema drift, prefs typo, sandbox issue, …) this fails loudly.

The tests use a temp cache dir per run (env var
`INVISIBLE_PLAYWRIGHT_CACHE_DIR`) so they never poison the developer's real
cache and never get false positives from a previously-cached binary.
