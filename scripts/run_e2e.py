"""Run the FULL e2e suite (every test that opens the browser) against a binary.

The 138 ``@pytest.mark.e2e`` tests are excluded from the default `pytest` run
(`addopts = -m 'not slow and not e2e'`) because they need a real Firefox binary
and a display, and they skip themselves when no binary is available. That makes
them easy to forget — and "we can't afford for something to not work". This is
the gate that runs them all, deliberately, against a chosen binary.

It is the MANDATORY pre-release e2e gate: run it green against the freshly-built
release binary BEFORE un-drafting a firefox-N (alongside the fppro + WebRTC
realness gates). It is NOT in the public CI drive-gate — the hosted runners are
content-process unstable under a heavy headless interaction sequence (see
70-known-bugs / 60-ci-release-pipeline); this runs locally on reliable hardware.

Flake-resilience: under full-suite load a couple of interaction tests (dblclick,
hover/mouseenter) can flake even though they pass 3/3 in isolation, so failures
are reran up to twice on the known transient signatures. A genuinely broken
binary fails all attempts. The webrtc e2e fake a TCP-only SOCKS locally (no
proxy/secrets), so the whole suite is offline.

Usage:
    python scripts/run_e2e.py <firefox-binary>
    python scripts/run_e2e.py            # uses $INVPW_BINARY_PATH
