- **Security issue?** Do **not** open a public issue — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- **The C++ patches** live in the companion repo [feder-cr/invisible_firefox](https://github.com/feder-cr/invisible_firefox) (branch `stealth/150`). Bugs in fingerprint spoofing usually belong there.

## Scope

This repository ships the **Python wrapper** (`invisible_playwright`) around a pre-built patched Firefox. In scope:

- The `InvisiblePlaywright` sync/async API and launcher
- The fingerprint sampler (`_fpforge`)
- Binary download/caching, CLI, proxy plumbing
- Tests, docs, examples, packaging

Out of scope (belongs in `invisible_firefox`):

- Changes to the Firefox C++ source
- New preferences exposed by the patched binary
- Canvas / WebGL / WebRTC / font spoofing logic

## Development setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/feder-cr/invisible_playwright.git
cd invisible_playwright
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m invisible_playwright fetch   # download the patched Firefox binary
```

Requires Python 3.11+ and one of: Windows x86_64, Linux x86_64.

## Running tests

```bash
pytest                # unit + integration (default — fast)
pytest -m e2e         # end-to-end, requires the patched binary
pytest -m slow        # wheel-build regression tests
```

Markers are defined in `pyproject.toml`. The default run excludes `slow` and `e2e`.

## Pull requests

1. Fork and create a topic branch (`fix/...`, `feat/...`, `docs/...`).
2. Keep PRs focused — one logical change per PR.
3. Add or update tests for any behavior change.
4. Make sure the default `pytest` run is green.
5. Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages (e.g. `fix(launcher): handle missing profile dir`).
6. Update `README.md` or `docs/` when changing user-visible behavior.
7. Open the PR against `main`, fill in the PR template, and link any related issue.

CI must be green before merge.

## Reporting bugs

Before opening, please:

- Search [existing issues](https://github.com/feder-cr/invisible_playwright/issues) — the bug may already be tracked.
- Reproduce on the **latest release** if possible.
- Confirm the issue is in the Python wrapper, not the patched Firefox itself. If a fingerprint is leaking or a detector flags the browser, open the issue at `feder-cr/invisible_firefox` instead.

Include:

- OS and version, Python version, `invisible_playwright` version (`invisible_playwright version`)
- A minimal reproduction
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Relevant logs / stack traces
